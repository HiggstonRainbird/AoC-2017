# Mathematica Advent of Code
# 2017

This repository stores my [Advent Of Code](http:http://adventofcode.com/2017/) solutions for 2017, written in Mathematica.  Some of these solutions are simple one-liners, and so don't have any READMEs associated with them, but some (marked in **bold**) are more involved and have explanations.
