# Mathematica Advent of Code
# 2017

This repository stores my [Advent Of Code](http:http://adventofcode.com/2017/) solutions for 2017, written in Mathematica.  Some of these solutions are simple one-liners, and others are procedural and not fundamentally different from most other common programming languages, and so don't have any READMEs associated with them.  Some (marked in **bold**) are more involved and have (or need) explanations.
